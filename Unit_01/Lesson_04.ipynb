    "**Forward Propagation**:\n",

    "The tanh (hyperbolic tangent) function is an activation function used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity into the model. It transforms input values into an output range between -1 and 1. This helps the network learn complex patterns in the data.\n",

    "### Key Points about tanh:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**:\n",
    "   - The tanh function is mathematically defined as:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     tanh(x) = e^x - e^{-x} / e^x + e^{-x}\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Here, e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Properties**:\n",
    "   - **Range**: The output of tanh lies between -1 and 1.\n",
    "   - **Shape**: It has an S-shaped (sigmoid-like) curve but is symmetric around the origin (zero-centered).\n",
    "   - **Gradient**: The derivative of tanh is:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     {d}/{dx} tanh(x) = 1 - tanh^2 (x)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This means that the gradients are smaller when the input is large in magnitude, which helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem to some extent.\n"
