    "### `Role of Deep Learning Layers`\n",
    "\n",
    "A layer in a deep learning model serves as a fundamental building block responsible for processing and transforming input data. Information flows sequentially through these layers, with each layer taking input from the previous layer and passing its transformed output to the next. This cascading process continues until the final layer generates the modelâ€™s output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer performs specific computations on its input, introducing non-linearity and abstraction. The transformed output, often called activations or feature maps, captures higher-level representations of complex patterns within the data.\n",

    "- **Dense (Fully Connected) Layer**: Connects each neuron to every neuron in the previous layer, capturing global patterns.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Convolutional Layer**: Processes grid-like data (e.g., images) using convolution operations to detect spatial patterns.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Recurrent Layer**: Processes sequential data with feedback loops, considering context from previous time steps (useful for tasks like natural language processing).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Pooling Layer**: Reduces spatial dimensions, retaining essential information for downsampling and feature selection.\n"
