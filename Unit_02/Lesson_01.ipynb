    "Now the value of net input can be any anything from -infinity to +infinity. The neuron doesn’t really know how to bound to value and thus is not able to decide the firing pattern. Thus the activation function is an important part of an artificial neural network. They basically decide whether a neuron should be activated or not. Thus it bounds the value of the net input. The activation function is a non-linear transformation that we do over the input before sending it to the next layer of neurons or finalizing it as output."
