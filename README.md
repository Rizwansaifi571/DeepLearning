## 📘 Introduction

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with multiple layers. It enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced learner, this repository has something for everyone.

## 🤖 Deep Learning Algorithms

Explore a variety of deep learning algorithms:

- 🌐 **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
- 🌀 **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- 🔁 **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
- 🔍 **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**
- 🔐 **Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)**
- 📊 **Mega Case Study**

## 🧠 Keras Tutorial

### Installation

Get started with Keras by installing it via Anaconda:

```bash
conda create -n keras_env python=3.8
conda activate keras_env
pip install keras
```

### Keras Backends

Keras supports multiple backends like TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK. By default, Keras uses TensorFlow.

### Keras Models

Keras provides two types of models:

- **Sequential Class**: Simplified model where layers are added one by one.
- **Model Class**: More complex model allowing for multi-input and multi-output.

### Keras Layers

Keras offers a variety of layers for building neural networks:

- **Core Layers**: Dense, Dropout, Activation, etc.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Conv1D, Conv2D, Conv3D
- **Pooling Layers**: MaxPooling, AveragePooling
- **Locally-Connected Layers**
- **Recurrent Layers**: LSTM, GRU, SimpleRNN
- **Embedding Layers**
- **Merge Layers**: Add, Subtract, Multiply, etc.
